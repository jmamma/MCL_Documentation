\\
\textit{Changes to MIDI settings are applied upon exiting the MIDI menu.}
\section{Turbo MIDI:}
The TURBO MIDI speed can be set for each port. To disabled turbo MIDI set the speed to 1x.\\\\
\textit{8x TURBO is recommended for best performance.\\
The MD MK1's max TURBO speed is limited to 4x when connected to the MC.
}
\section{Device 2: }
Set to either: General MIDI (Gener) or Elektron (Elekt)\\

This option sets the default MIDI driver for port 2. Supported Elektron devices have
more advanced features such as retaining kit/sound data when saving/loading slots,
The general MIDI driver will only save/load MIDI sequencer data.\\
\\
\textit{If you are intending to pair your Megacommand with an Elektron device
(MNM, A4) set this to Elektron. For all other MIDI devices, set this to General MIDI (default setting).}
\section{MIDI Clock:}
MCL does not generate its own MIDI Clock, instead it relies on a clock signal from either port 1 or port 2.\\\\
The CLK REC parameter can be used to set the receive port for the MIDI clock.\\
The CLK SEND parameter can be used to forward the MIDI Clock from port 1 to port 2.\\\\
\textit{Note: The MD's clock settings are controlled by MCL and will be automatically configured based on the options selected above.}
\section{MIDI Forward:}
The MIDI FWD option allows you to forward non-realtime MIDI messages received on Port 1 to the MIDI out of Port 2 or vice versa.
\section{CC Forward:}
The CC FWD option allows you to forward CC MIDI messages received on Port 2 IN to the MIDI OUT of Port 2.
\section{PRG Mode:}
MIDI Program Change IN has two modes of operation, BASIC or ADV (Advanced).
\begin{itemize}
    \item{ \textbf{BASIC:} Program Change Receive will "Group Load" an entire row according to Load Page mode and Group Select settings. }
    \item{  \textbf{ADV:} Program change receive will set the row for slots to be loaded from.\\\\ MIDI notes from C3 upwards on Port 2 can be used to select slots to be loaded.\\\\  In this way, you can load any slot (or multiple slots) using a combination of Program Change + MIDI note. \\\\
 If Program Change is not received before MIDI note on/off, MCL will load from the current selected GUI row. }
 \\
 MCL cannot load instantaneously, there is a minimum 1 bar delay.
\end{itemize}
\section{PRG In:}
Set the receive channel for Program Change and Note messages on Port 2.\\\\
When set to -- (default) Program Change In is disabled.
\section{PRG Out:}
Set the send channel for Program Change messages on Port 2, which are sent when loading slots or rows.\\\\
When set to -- (default) Program Change Out is is disabled.
