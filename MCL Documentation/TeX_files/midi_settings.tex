\section{Turbo MIDI:}
The TURBO MIDI speed can be set for each port (8x turbo is recommended for best performance.) To disabled turbo MIDI set the speed to 1x.
\section{MIDI Clock:}
MCL does not generate its own MIDI Clock, instead it relies on a clock signal from either port 1 or port 2.\\\\
The CLK REC parameter can be used to set the receive port for the MIDI clock.\\
The CLK SEND parameter can be used to forward the MIDI Clock from port 1 to port 2.\\\\
\textit{Note: The MD's clock settings are controlled by MCL and will be automatically configured based on the options selected above.}

\section{MIDI Forward:}
The MIDI FWD option allows you to forward non-realtime MIDI messages received on port 1 to the MIDI out of port 2 or vice versa.
\section{Device 2: }
Set to either: General MIDI (Gener) or Elektron (Elekt)\\

This option sets the default MIDI driver for port 2. Supported Elektron devices have
more advanced features such as retaining kit/sound data when saving/loading slots,
The general MIDI driver will only save/load MIDI sequencer data.\\
\\
\textit{If you are intending to pair your Megacommand with an Elektron device
(MNM, A4) set this to Elektron. For all other MIDI devices, set this to General MIDI (default setting).}
