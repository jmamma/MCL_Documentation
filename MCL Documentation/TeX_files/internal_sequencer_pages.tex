\chapter{MCL Sequencer Pages:}

\textit{The primary Sequencer Pages are accessed using the \textbf{<Page>} button.} These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (MD) Step Editor Page
    \item (Ext MIDI) PianoRoll Editor Page
    \item (MD/Ext MIDI) Chromatic Page
\end{itemize}
\section{Track selection}
For the Step Editor page the current track selection is synced to the Machinedrum. When you change track on the MD the track will change on the MegaCommand.\\\\
For the PianoRoll Editor page, the current track can be selected from the PianoRoll menu's TRACK SELECT option. Alternatively, if an external MIDI device is connected to port 2, the track will automatically change to the first EXT track that is set to the same MIDI channel as incoming note data.
\section{Live Record:}
\textit{Live Record mode can be activated from any Sequencer page by pressing \textbf{<Save >}.\\Alternatively, hold \textbf{[REC]} and press \textbf{[Play]} on the MD to activate record mode.}\\\\Depending upon the page type, Live Record can be used to capture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trig presses
    \item Parameter changes, CC Automation
    \item Notes played in Chromatic Mode
    \item Notes played on the PianoRoll page.
\end{itemize}
\textit{Pressing \textbf{<Load>} during a recording will clear the sequence for the current track.}
