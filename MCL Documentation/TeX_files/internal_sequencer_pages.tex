\chapter{MCL Sequencer Pages:}

\textit{The primary Sequencer Pages are accessed using the \textbf{PageSelect} page. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (MD) Step Edit Page
    \item (Ext MIDI) PianoRoll Page
    \item (MD/Ext MIDI) Chromatic Page
\end{itemize}}
\section{Track selection}
For the Step Edit and Parameter Edit pages, the current track selection is synced to the Machinedrum. When you change track on the MD the track will change on the MegaCommand.\\\\
For the PianoRoll page, the current track can be selected from the PianoRoll menu's TRACK SELECT option. Alternatively, if an external MIDI device is connected to port 2, the track will automatically change to the first EXT track that is set to the same MIDI channel as incoming note data.
\\\\
\textit{Automatic track select can be disabled from the MCL system menu option Global -> Machinedrum -> TRACK SELECT}
\section{Live Record:}
Live Record mode can be activated from any Sequencer page by pressing \textbf{[ Save ]}.\\Depending upon the page type, live Record can be used to record:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Trig presses
    \item Parameter changes, CC Automation
    \item Notes played in Chromatic Mode
    \item Notes played on the PianoRoll page.
\end{itemize}
Pressing \textbf{[ Load ]} during a recording will clear the sequence for the current track.
