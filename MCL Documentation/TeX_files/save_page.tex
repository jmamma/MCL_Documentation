\chapter{Save Page}

The Save Page is used to save track data to specific slots in the current row of the visible  Grid.\\
\\
Available save modes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SEQ: Save internal sequencer data and associated device's sound data.
\end{itemize}
Two additional modes apply only to the Machinedrum:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MD: Copy MD Sequencer data. Save MD sequencer data and MD sound data. Internal sequencer data is not saved.
    \item MERGE: Merge MD Sequencer data with internal sequencer. Save sequencer data and MD sound data.
\end{itemize}
\textit{MD and MERGE modes are only available when the sequencer playback is stopped.}

\section{Saving Individual Tracks}
The Save Page uses the MD's Trigger Interface to specify which slots are to be saved. Pressing multiple trigger buttons and then releasing them will save the corresponding slots in the current row of the visible Grid.
\section{Grid Toggle}
When in the Save or Load page, the \textbf{[ Shift 1 ]} button can be used to toggle between Grid X or Grid Y.
\section{Simultaneous Save from Grid X and Grid Y}
It is possible to simultaneously save a collection of tracks from both Grids A and B. 
\begin{itemize}
\item First select the tracks from one Grid Yy pressing and holding the corresponding triggers.
\item Tap \textbf{[ Shift 1 ]} to switch grids
\item Release the trig selection
\item Select tracks from the alternate Grid Yy pressing and holding the corresponding triggers. 
\item Finally release the second grid selection to confirm the action. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Save Track Groups:}
When in the Save or Load Page, holding the \textbf{[ Shift 2 ]} button opens a Group Select menu,
allowing you to load or save all tracks corresponding to a group. An entire row/pattern across both grids A+B can be saved this way.\\
\\
There are four groups:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MIDI Device 1 (MD)
    \item MIDI Device 2 (A4/MNM/Generic MIDI)
    \item FX (MDFX + LFOTrack + RouteTrack)
    \item TEMPO
\end{enumerate}
From the Group Select Menu each group can be enabled/disabled using the MD's trigger interface.\\
\\
Releasing \textbf{[ Shift 2 ]} will save/load tracks corresponding to the active groups.
