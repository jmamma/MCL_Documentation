\chapter{Mixer Page:}
The Mixer Page serves as the core performance hub for MCL. Initially, it displays the volume levels and mute states for the Machinedrum. Moreover, it can be configured to control and display the mute state of External MIDI tracks. When playing, the level meters fluctuate to indicate that the track has been triggered by the sequencer.

\textit{The Mixer Page is accessible by pressing \textbf{[Bank Group] + [Trig 2]}}

\section{Device Selection}
The \textbf{[Scale]} button can be used to toggle between the MD or the External MIDI tracks.

\section{Performance Controllers}
The four MegaCommand encoders are the Performance Controller's (A,B,C,D) as configured from the Performance Page or loaded from the PF Track stored in Grid Y, column 12.

\section{MDFX}
For quick access to FX Delay and FX Reverb pages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item hold \textbf{[Exit/No]} + toggle \textbf{[Left]} for DELAY.
    \item hold \textbf{[Exit/No]} + toggle \textbf{[Down]} for REVERB.
\end{itemize}
\section{CTRL-Track}
The Mixer Page allows you to modify multiple parameters across different tracks simultaneously,
The Machinedrum \textbf{[Encoders]} can be used to manipulate any specific parameter across selected tracks, similar to the MD's built in CTRL-ALL functionality.\\\\
When the MD's  \textbf{[Trig]} are held down, modifying a MD parameter will cause the same parameter to be updated on all of the selected tracks.
\section{Track Recall}
\textit{Holding MD \textbf{[Trigs]} and pressing \textbf{[Classic/Extended]} will reset the parameters of each track to the value set last load.}
\section{Solo}
Holding down one or more the MD's \textbf{[Trig]} keys and then pressing \textbf{[Exit/No]} will solo the selected tracks for the active device.
\newpage
\section{Mute Toggle}
Holding down one or more the MD's \textbf{[Trig]} keys and then pressing \textbf{[Enter/Yes]} will toggle the selected track's mute state for the active device.
\section{Flip Mutes}
Holding \textbf{[Function]} and then pressing \textbf{[Enter/Yes]} will flip the mutes for the active device.
\section{Mute Sets}
A mute set is a pre-defined mute state consisting of mutes for both devices.\\\\  When a mute set is loaded, all of the track's mutes across both devices are changed to match the loaded set. Four separate mute sets can be loaded individually by holding one of the MD's cursor keys \textbf{[Up/Down/Left/Right]} and then pressing \textbf{[Enter/Yes]}\\\\
Mute sets can be previewed and edited by holding down a cursor key. When previewing a mute set, the mutes can be adjusted by toggling the MD's trig keys. No changes to the current mute state will occur until the mute set is loaded.
\section{Performance Controller Locks}
When a mute set is previewed, holding \textbf{[Exit/No]} whilst rotating one of the MC \textbf{<Encoders>} will add a Performance Controller Lock for the corresponding Performance Controller.  The Performance Controller Locks will be recalled upon loading a chosen mute set. (See section: Performance Page.)   Controller locks visually invert when locked to mute set and can be cleared by pressing the\textbf{ <Encoder>}.

\section{Save and Load Mute Sets / Performance Controller Locks}
Mute Sets and Performance Controller can be stored and loaded from the \textbf{PF} slot in track 12, Grid Y. (See section: Performance Page.)


\section{Sequencer Mute Record}
Mutes can be recorded into the sequencer in realtime by selecting a track via the MD \textbf{[Trig]} and pressing \textbf{[Global]}.\\\\
Sequencer mutes can be cleared for a specific track by holding \textbf{[Trig]} and pressing \textbf{[Kit]}.\\\\
Sequencer mutes can be cleared for all tracks by holding \textbf{[Global]} and pressing \textbf{[Kit]}.
