The MD's \textbf{[Trig]} keys are is used in conjunction with \textbf{<Encoder 1>} to raise or lower the volume of multiple tracks simultaneously. The remaining encoders can be used to adjust the filter parameters of the selected tracks.\\\\
\textit{The Machinedrum \textbf{[Encoder]}s can be used to manipulate any specific parameter across selected tracks, similar to the MD's built in CTRL-ALL functionality.}
\section{Recall Tracks}
\textit{Selecting a MD \textbf{[Trig]} and pressing either \textbf{<Shift>} or \textbf{[No]} will reset the parameters of each track to the value set during their last load.}
