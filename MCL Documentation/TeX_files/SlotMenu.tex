\chapter{Slot Menu:}
The Slot Menu is used to clear, copy, paste one or more slots and to configure a slot's LEN (length,) LOOP \& JUMP settings. It also provides an option to rename the current row and to alternate the active Grid between X or Y.

\\
\textit{The Slot Menu is accessible from the GridPage by holding down the MD's \textbf{[Exit/No]} key.\\\\When \textbf{[Exit/No]} is released, any changes to the menu will be applied to the selected slots. }
\section{Multiple Slot Selection:}
A rectangular selection containing multiple slots can be made by entering the slot menu (holding \textbf{[Exit/No])} and using the MD's \textbf{[Up/Down/Left/Right]} arrow keys. 
Alternatively rotating MCLs \textbf{< Encoder 3>} and \textbf{<Encoder 4>}can be used to make a selection.
