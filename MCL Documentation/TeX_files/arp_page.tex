\chapter{Arpeggiator Page:}
The Arpeggiator Page allows control of each track's dedicated Arpeggiator. Arpeggiator settings are not retained when saving or loading tracks, the generated sequence can however be recorded to the track in realtime.

The Arpeggiator has 3 states of operation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item -- (Off)
    \item ON
    \item LATCH (Notes are held down)
\end{enumerate}

When enabled, the arpeggiator will play when the sequencer is running.
