\section{Quantization Modes:}
 Quantization modes are used to control the timing of the routing changes so that they are in sync with the sequencer.
 \\
 When a numerical quantization value is chosen the selected track’s cue will be toggled on the next specified multiple of the step-count.
 \begin{itemize}
\item --: No quantization.
\item 02: Toggle cue on next possible 2nd step
\item 04: Toggle cue on next possible 4th step
\item 08: Toggle cue on next possible 8th step 
\item 16: Toggle cue on next possible 16th step 
\item 32: Toggle cue on next possible 32th step 
\item 64: Toggle cue on next possible 64th step
 \end{itemize}
