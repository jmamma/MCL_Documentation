 \chapter{Route Page:}
 The Route Page is used to direct the audio of a specific MD track to a selected output.\\\\\textit{Routing configuration can be either stored or recalled by saving or loading to the corresponding Auxiliary track Route slot.} \\

\textit{The Chromatic page can be accessed by pressing \textbf{<Page>/[Global]} and \textbf{[Trig 3]}.}

\textbf{<Encoder 1>} can be used to select the audio output destination. The destination can be one of MD's external outputs C, D, E, F.

The MD's \textbf{[Trig]} keys are used to toggle the output of selected tracks, between Main Outputs and the chosen external output.

\section{Quantization Modes:}
 Quantization modes are used to control the timing of the routing changes so that they are in sync with the sequencer.
 \\
 When a numerical quantization value is chosen the selected trackâ€™s cue will be toggled on the next specified multiple of the step-count. Holding down the encoder button will step increment the quantization value.
\item --: No quantization.
\item 02: Toggle cue on next possible 2nd step
\item 04: Toggle cue on next possible 4th step
\item 08: Toggle cue on next possible 8th step 
\item 16: Toggle cue on next possible 16th step 
\item 32: Toggle cue on next possible 32th step 
\item 64: Toggle cue on next possible 64th step
 \end{itemize}
 
 \section{Saving/Loading:}
The routing configuration can be saved and loaded from Grid Y in Auxiliary slot 14 (Route) along with Polyphonic configuration. In addition, routing is automatically retained across power on/off.\\\\
\textit{For more information on slot positions and their corresponding tracks see  "Sequencer: Saving and Loading".}
