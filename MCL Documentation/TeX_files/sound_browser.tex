\chapter{Sound Manager Page}
Machinedrum Sound presets can be stored via the Sound Manager page.  A sound preset includes a track's machine assignment, and it's associated parameters. It can consist of machine settings from a single track, or two tracks linked by a TrigGroup.\\
\\
Sound Presets are stored on the MegaCommand's SD Card as a $.snd$ file type.
