\section{Project Files:}
Projects are stored on the SD Card in the \textbackslash{}Projects\textbackslash{} directory.
Each project has its own folder, inside the project folder there are 3 files:
\begin{verbatim}
\Projects\new_project_000\
                          |- new_project_000.mcl   <- Project master file
                          |- new_project_000.0     <- Grid X data
                          |- new_project_000.1     <- Grid Y data
\end{verbatim}

\section{Saving Projects:}
While loading projects recalls all saved track information, saving projects is not necessary. The project file is updated whenever slots or tracks are saved in the grid.
