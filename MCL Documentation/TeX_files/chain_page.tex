\chapter{Load Page}
The Load page is used to load slots from the Grid. When a slot is loaded, Machine/Sound data is sent to the corresponding MIDI device and the sequencer track is loaded into the internal sequencer.\\
\\
The Load Page behaviour depends on whether the sequencer is actively running:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the sequencer is in a stopped state, the selected slots will be loaded immediately.
    \item If the sequencer is in a running state, the slots will be placed in the transition queue, to be loaded at the next interval defined by the selected quantization rule
\end{itemize}

\textit{The Load Page is accessible from the GridPage by pressing the  \textbf{[ Load ]} function button.}

\section{Loading Individual Tracks}
The Load Page uses the MD's Trigger Interface to specify which slots are to be loaded. Pressing multiple trigger buttons and then releasing them will load the corresponding slots from the current row of the visible Grid.
\section{Grid Toggle}
When in the Save or Load page, the \textbf{[ Shift 1 ]} button can be used to toggle between Grid X or Grid Y.
\newpage
\section{Simultaneous Load from Grid X and Grid Y}
It is possible to simultaneously load a collection of tracks from both Grids A and B. 
\begin{itemize}
\item First select the tracks from one Grid Yy pressing and holding the corresponding triggers.
\item Tap \textbf{[ Shift 1 ]} to switch grids
\item Release the trig selection
\item Select tracks from the alternate Grid Yy pressing and holding the corresponding triggers. 
\item Finally release the second grid selection to confirm the action. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Load Track Groups:}
When in the Save or Load Page, holding the \textbf{[ Shift 2 ]} button opens a Group Select menu,
allowing you to load or save all tracks corresponding to a group. An entire row/pattern across both grids A+B can be loaded this way.\\
\\
There are four groups:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item MIDI Device 1 (MD)
    \item MIDI Device 2 (A4/MNM/Generic MIDI)
    \item FX (MDFX + LFOTrack + RouteTrack)
    \item TEMPO
\end{enumerate}
From the Group Select Menu each group can be enabled/disabled using the MD's trigger interface.\\
\\
Releasing \textbf{[ Shift 2 ]} will save/load tracks corresponding to the active groups.
\section{Quantization Rules}
The quantization rules specify the transition interval for the selected slots.\\
\\
The minimum Quantization value is 4 steps. Quantization values can be changed by adjusting the "Q:" parameter and increase in powers of 2.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item 04: Toggle cue on next possible 4th step
\item 08: Toggle cue on next possible 8th step 
\item 16: Toggle cue on next possible 16th step 
\item 32: Toggle cue on next possible 32th step 
\item 64: Toggle cue on next possible 64th step
\end{itemize}
